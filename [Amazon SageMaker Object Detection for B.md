[Amazon SageMaker Object Detection for Bird Species](https://sagemaker-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction_to_amazon_algorithms/object_detection_birds/object_detection_birds.html)

Object detection is the process of identifying and localizing objects in an image. A typical object detection solution takes an image as input and provides a bounding box on the image where an object of interest is found. It also identifies what type of object the box encapsulates.

keynote on the code

[`sys.executable`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html)    
A string giving the absolute path of the executable binary for the Python interpreter, on systems where this makes sense. If Python is unable to retrieve the real path to its executable, sys.executable will be an empty string or None.
